## Classes

### Artificer
You are an artificer, an expert alchemist and forge master, gear priest, and black powder savant. You might be a reclusive tinker, a burly gadgeteer, a fume addled apothecary or haughty steamsmith.

Hammer in hand and hellfire at your belt, you travel abroad in search of inspiration, putting your unique devices to the test. Most folk brand you a menace; a heretic meddling in secret and unstable forces, destined for an early grave. And perhaps they're right. Yet no man lives forever, and all kingdoms fade; what matters is whether your next discovery will change the world.

### Barbarian
You are a barbarian, a savage warrior from the tundra, mountains, deep forests, or sandy wastes. You might be a Viking raider, a Conan like behemoth, or an Amazonian warrior woman. 

Unlike soft city dwellers, your long exposure to harsh elements has equipped you with primal ferocity, acute instincts, and formidable endurance. You are well versed in the use of weapons, but prefer armors that do not hinder your natural athleticism. Most barbarians are superstitious, illiterate, and have an abiding distrust of magic.

### Bard
You are a bard, a charismatic wanderer; part artist, diplomat, and warrior, as skilled with blades as you are with ballads. You might be a fearsome skald, a celebrated performer, or a master of whispers. In your travels you draw knowledge from all corners, forging alliances and extracting secrets from those who should know better.  
A bard's influence fortifies the company, strengthening bonds and the common will to prevail. With the right words and deeds, the bard elevates the party beyond the sum of its parts.

- **Abilities**: Silver Tongued, Inspire Greatness

### Cultist
You are a cultist, the devoted servant of a god,daemon, or other cosmic entity distant and inscrutable. You might be a pious priestess, an unflinching inquisitor, or a haunted warlock  
struggling to avert a terrible doom. 

Like all travellers of perilous lands, you are familiar with weapons and armor, mindful that the divine help those who help themselves. Yet in your hour of need, when the flesh fails and the shield splinters, you call upon your goddess for aid. And if you have kept the tenets, and earnt Her favor, She answers.

- **Key Attribute(s)**: Willpower.

- **Abilities**: Blessings, Sacred Lore

### Fighter

You are a fighter, a veteran warrior expertly trained in weapons and armor. Perhaps you are a mail clad knight, an agile spearman, or a sharp eyed bowman. Fighters are versatile masters of all weapons, switching between armaments and combat styles to best meet the foe at hand. 

The fighter is the most heavily armed and armored adventurer in the game. You are comfortable in the thick of battle, relying on brawn, steel, and superior skill to win the day.

- **Abilities**: Adaptable, Deadly Strikes

### Magic User
You are a magic user, a student of strange and supernatural powers that are not well understood. You might be a mysterious conjurer, a dread witchdoctor, or an eccentric sorcerer with a six demon bag. 

Magic is the most multi-faceted power in the game: it can conjure lightning, invoke spirits, beguile onlookers, or mend wounds in the blink of an eye. But there is a price to be paid, and no spell is uttered lightly. Like any adventurer, the magic user knows the value of a sharp blade and steady arm.

- **Key Attribute(s)**: Intelligence.  
- **Hit Points**: Equal to Con score + Level.

- **Abilities**: Spellcraft, Sense Magic

### Monk
You are a monk, a pilgrim adventurer and martial artist, travelling the world in search of enlightenment. You might be a peacekeeping vagabond, a reclusive mystic, or a vigilante drifter. Raised by your order, you lack family attachment and eschew material things, focusing instead on the perfect alignment of mind, body, and spirit.

Unarmed and unarmored, only a fool mistakes you for easy prey. A lifetime of training has forged you into a fearsome weapon; strong as the mountain and supple as the wind, you perform deeds others hold impossible. Your discipline and spirit burn brighter than the sun.

- **Abilities**: Martial Arts, Monk Techniques

### Ranger
You are a ranger, a hunter of monsters and men; scout of the borderlands and sentinel of civilization. You might be a faultless tracker, a brave woodsmen, a grizzled beastmaster, or a veteran explorer. 

Bold and self reliant, your skill with the bow is rightly feared and your herbalist lore respected. Many consider you a lone wolf, but your party allies and beast friend provide all the fellowship you need. Beholden to none, you alone decide your fate; free as a bird and boundless as the sky.

- **Abilities**: Beast Companion, Rangercraft

## Rogue

You are a rogue, a lurker in the shadows, gifted in acrobatics, stealth, and sleight of hand. You might be a brave scout, a sly thief, a deadly assassin, or a haughty pirate. In any guise, agility and cunning are the rogue's hallmarks. 

Lightly armored, you rely on speed and guile to keep you from harm, employing a range of tricks and deceits to maintain the upper hand. When you strike, your sword comes without warning, dropping opponents before they realise the true threat on the battlefield.

## Races

### Dwarf

Dwarves are short, naturally hardy, and highly resistant to arcane forces. All dwarves suffer from gold lust and take great pride in their honour and ancestry. They have better night vision than most humans, but are just as blind in the absence of light. The deep roads are well lit if dwarves are nearby.

* **Advantage** when resisting poison and magic. Positive magical effects however provide only half the usual benefits (where possible, for example duration, amount of healed hit points, etc).  
* May make a **Perception** check to sniff out a handful of silver or gold coins, or a single gemstone, within Close range.

### Elf

Elves possess a natural grace and agility that puts humans to shame, but have fragile constitutions. Like all fey, they are inherently bound to the wild places of the world, coupled with haughty and aloof spirits (an artifact of their extraordinarily long lives). Like dwarves, elves have better night vision than most humans, but are just as blind in the absence of light. In the shadows of the elder forests, elves employ soft lighting to guide their way.

* **Advantage** when making Dex checks and defensive **Luck** (Dex) saves.  
* **Disadvantage** on **Luck** (Con) saves and Con checks.  
* Elves do not sleep, instead entering a trance like contemplation for six hours. They count as being on *Look Out* duty during this time, but with a **\-3 penalty** on Perc tests.  
* The GM may require a Will check to resist engaging with sites of great natural beauty, or to demonstrate elven superiority or disinterest when the opportunity arises.

### Halfling

Halflings are three feet tall, nimble and light footed, sometimes mistaken for portly human children at a distance. They have a natural gift for hiding, dodging, and moving silently, and are seemingly blessed with good fortune. Halflings are highly curious and overly fond of comforts such as rich foods, alcohol, pipeweed, and sleep.

* **Advantage** on stealth related checks. Disad on Str related checks (exc melee attack/damage).  
* Increase your starting **Luck** and **AC by \+1 point** (the **AC** bonus is lost if using **Heavy** armor). PC allies within sight or hearing also increase their **Luck by \+1** (does not stack).  
  \[Armor Class\](\!whatis class 'armor class')  
* Cannot wield large weapons such as great swords, polearms, and long bows. Require two hands to use longswords or similar moderately sized weapons (they do not gain the usual \+1 damage bonus for doing so, if applicable). Small weapons (e.g. shortswords, shortbows) operate as normal.  
* Lifestyle costs are doubled (see Rules p.57), and the GM may require a Will check to resist your prying nature, or to curb potential indulgence.

### Half-Skorn

Half-Skorn are taller than most humans, invariably heavy set, with pinkish skin, wide jaws and small, misshapen ears. They are hard to kill, strong, and bug resistant, but display poor memory and analytical ability. Half-skorn are prone to instincts for war, conquest and strife, making it difficult to maintain peaceful lives. Like dwarves, half-skorn have better night vision than most humans, but are just as blind without light.

* **Advantage** on strength related tests (excluding melee attack/damage rolls), and to resist disease and parasites.  
* **Disadvantage** on intelligence related checks (excluding spell casting and Initiative checks).  
* Gain a **\+2 bonus** on **Death** saves (does not stack with the **\+2 bonus** for healing magic or other **Death** save bonuses).  
* The GM might require a Will check to resist showing dominance or fearlessness in the face of an overt threat or challenge.

### Human

Humans have a flair for adaptability and problem solving. They exhibit wide variability and often enjoy the largest population centres in lower magic settings. If the GM allows PC races other than humans, humans gain the following benefits:

* Increase *maximum* **Rerolls** by 1\.  
* During character creation, **apply \+1** to an  
  **attribute** of your choice (**maximum 16,**  
  *cannot* be applied to **Luck** or **Initiative**).
